# Little Stack Machine (LSM)
The Little Stack Machine (LSM) is a stack-based virtual machine implementation

The reason for the LSM is because:
- reinforces understanding of virtual machines and how they operate
- looks good on my uni application
- also helps me learn rust to a better standard
- and acts as a foundation for a 'Little Compiler' project in the future (which would help as preparation for Computer Construction in a Computer Science degree)
